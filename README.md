Who Am I?
=========
"Who Am I?" is a small website that determines your interests by
exploiting a:visited in CSS.

It was originally written as a proof-of-concept for a few people on IRC.

I would suggest that you don't run update.py too often, as it does not use
an official feedly API, and I don't want to spam their servers.

This is basically a rewrite of the [original](http://tinsnail.neocities.org),
and though its core is better, it currently lacks graphing.
